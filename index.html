        I created this along with my chance to showcase my not-so-much physically interactive hobby—which is watching movies. The moment I realized that I like to watch movies was when I was in Elementary. At that time, I still didn't have a phone. And if I had one, probably it must be a keypad design. I spent most of my time as a kid watching shows that I really liked or found entertaining. To the point that my parents would not open the television, because they were afraid that my eyes would strain or have any eye-related medical condition. But that didn't stop me, because eventually I learned how to operate a computer. And from that point on, I have watched maybe hundreds of movies.
        <br><br>
        Among those movies I've watched, there are only a few or a particular plot that I like. Because the plot is nice or well-written; the plot or the movie itself is totally fascinating and amazing to watch.
        <br><br>
        Since I already explained the origin of my hobby, now let me introduce you to those movies I really like and I've rewatched numerous times.

        The Hunger Games film series follows Katniss Everdeen, a young woman who volunteers to take her sister's place in a brutal competition controlled by the oppressive Capitol, which forces children from twelve districts to fight to the death. In the first film, Katniss navigates the deadly arena alongside fellow tribute Peeta Mellark, becoming a symbol of rebellion against the Capitol. As the series progresses, particularly in Catching Fire, Katniss and Peeta face the repercussions of their defiance as they return to the arena for a special edition of the Games, further igniting unrest in the districts. In Mockingjay – Part 1 and Part 2, Katniss embraces her role as the "Mockingjay," rallying support for a revolution while confronting the moral complexities of war and ultimately leading the fight to overthrow the Capitol. The series explores themes of survival, sacrifice, and the impact of media on society.

         The Scream film series centers on a group of teenagers and young adults who become targets of a mysterious killer known as Ghostface, who often taunts them with references to horror movie tropes. In the first film, Scream, high school student Sidney Prescott must confront Ghostface as he murders her friends and uncovers dark secrets related to her past. In Scream 2, Sidney is in college when a new wave of killings begins, forcing her to confront a killer inspired by the events of the first film. The series continues with Scream 3, set on a movie set where the characters face a Ghostface killer linked to Sidney's family history. In Scream 4, a decade later, Sidney returns to her hometown for a book signing, only to find herself targeted by a new Ghostface. Throughout the series, a blend of slasher horror and self-aware humor examines themes of survival, trauma, and the influence of media on violence, as Sidney and her friends fight to uncover the killer's identity and escape the deadly game.

In Godzilla: King of the Monsters (2019), Godzilla faces formidable foes like King Ghidorah and Mothra, while in Godzilla vs. Kong (2021), he battles King Kong, revealing the ancient rivalry between them. Throughout the series, themes of environmentalism, the impact of human actions, and Godzilla’s dual role as both a destructive force and a protector of the Earth are examined, making him a multifaceted symbol in popular culture.
